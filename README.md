A Project

There will be some code here someday. 

My name is Jeremy. I'm 24 years old. I've just started learning code because I need something to work on that feels productive.
I don't know excatly what kind of software I'm going to build yet. I have a lot left to learn. Someday I want to own a software factory/innovation farm. I just want a bunch of smart people working together to make cool stuff.
